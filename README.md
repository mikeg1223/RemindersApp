# Reminders App

This is my personal copy of a school project I did for a software engineering course.

## What was our project?
We were tasked with creating an application that could store reminders for a user, and organize these reminders based on type.
The application must be created for android specifically, and must be accompanied by documentations supporting it. 

## What was I responsible for?
I was responsible for being the PM, designing the database, linking database functionality to buttons/widgets, creating the log-in functionality, 
creating the save functionality for account changes, and creating the scrolling behaviors for the main pages. 
I held weekly meetings were responsibilities and progress was discussed. We chose to adhere to a waterfall style development process. 

## What did I learn?
I learned about software development and leading a team. Going through all of the phases of software development helped me learn the benefits of
organization and structuring the development process. I learned about how to find the strengths in my team members to make sure we excelled as a whole. 
I also learned quite a bit about app development for android using android studio with java. I leanred about android architecture and many 
of the different android api requests possible. I applied knowledge I had learned in a Database Systems course to create a SQLite based database and link create 
custom queries to work with our application.
